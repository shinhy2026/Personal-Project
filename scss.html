                        When you hover over this box, the two contrasting boxes (black box at the top left and transparent box at the bottom right, located behind the main box that contains this text) will switch their places by diagonally moving across the page.

                        Pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. For example, it can be used to insert content before, or after, the content of an element. By using pseudo-elements of ::before and ::after which will divide the top and bottom boxes into two separate parts, I set the top-left box the ::before element and the bottom right box the ::after element with each positioned with <code>top: ±15px; left: ±15px;</code>. I made the transition animation using a pseudo-class of <code>:hover</code>, in which pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element and <code>:hover</code> applies the properties of the selector to be set to something then it is hovered over.
Using a SCSS feature of ampersand (&) which allows me to nest selectors, I could make the animation with this code: <code>&::before, &::after {transition: all .25s ease-out;}</code> nested inside the <code>:hover</code>, which changes each position of the ::before and ::after to one another. The transition property allows the audience to see the process of changing positions. The ‘.25s’ makes the animation occur for 0.25 seconds, and ‘ease-out’ makes it slowly start to slowly fade out.

                                When you hover over these boxes, from white background, the black background will gradually emerge from bottom to top. When you unhover the model, the background will return to white and the black background will go back its path to the bottom gradually.

                                These two boxes are aligned and positioned with flexbox layout. In the <code>.box-model {display: flex;}</code> selector, the display property sets the value as flex so that I can use flexbox layout properties. <code>flex-wrap: row;</code> horizontally (row) aligns the two boxes, and <code>justify-content: space-between;</code> distributes the space, gives a gap between the boxes.

                                In this SCSS feature, there are two parts of the model, the white background and the black background. The black background is set as the before pseudo-class <code>&:before</code>. With SCSS ampersand nested inside a selector, the selector with the ampersand inside inherits all the properties of the super-selector. Thus the :before pseudo-class follow the same property values of its super-selector, <code>#box-pop</code>, so that the design is the same as the white background except for the background color and transform property, which is differentiated in the <code>&:before</code>.

                                The properties and values of <code>transform: scaleY(0); transform-origin: 0 bottom 0;</code> sets the black background to not to be seen with no area currently covering and at the very bottom, and <code>transition: .4s ease-out;</code> applies the animation by giving a moment for the black background to move to the top for 0.4 seconds, instead of moving so quickly that we can’t see the movement. The <code>&:before {transform: scaleY(1);}</code> is nested inside <code>&:hover</code>. This means that :before (the black background) is nested inside the <code>:hover</code>, and will be activated when the content is hovered. <code>scaleY(1);</code> value will bring the black from the bottom to the top of the box, changing the colour.

                                The default appearance of the card is a small rectangle with a round border-radius, with a text “hover me” written in the middle center of the box. When hovered, the small rectangle expands into a larger box with new text appearing.

                                The default (x hover) is that the property <code>clip-path: inset(0 0 80% 80% round 3%);</code> clips the white content block to a small section so that we can only see the small section of the white rectangle. <code>clip-path</code> is a CSS property that creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden. Its value, <code>inset()</code>, clips a rectangle. The first four numbers set the offsets of each side from the reference box inward that define the positions of the edges. <code>round 3%</code> indicates the border-radius, meaning that it curves the edges.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card__text">
                                On hover with <code>&:hover</code>, <code>clip-path: inset(0 0 0% 0% round 4%);</code> makes a difference in the inset() value, so that the white rectangle is fully visible without clipping (except for the border radius). Nested inside the :hover pseudo-class, when hovered, the property <code>opacity: 0;</code> makes the text “hover me” disappear as the opacity becomes 0, that was once 1. With <code>transition: all ease-in-out .3s;</code>, the “ease-in-out” value allows for both the expansion and returning to the default state to be animated. With <code>transition:ease-out .3s;</code>, the main text that was hidden will also be visible when expanded, and disappear when hovered.

Then I rotated the outer wrapper so the top side is on the left and the bottom is on the right. In this way, I could turn a vertical scroll into a horizontal one. However, the content blocks themselves were still rotated and not in the right place, thus I rotated the inner wrapper back so that the content is in the right position. This technique is called double CSS transform.</p>
                        <p class="footer__text"><strong class="topic" style="text-decoration: underline;">SVG waves</strong>: The waves and shapes between sections are created with SVG, a vector based image. Taking pre-made waves/shapes in SVG files, I put them into a class of “wave”, which initially resulted in the waves to be positioned at the top of the page. I then rescaled <code>.wave {width: 100vh;}</code>, rotated and positioned <code>{transform: rotate(-90deg) translateY(-45vh) translatex(-45vh);}</code> all the shapes at the left end of each section</p>
